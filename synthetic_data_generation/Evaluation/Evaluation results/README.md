This folder contains the evaluation metrics for all models across all waves generated by `generate_evals.py`.
- A dataset named `density_shape.csv`, with models as the attributes, and waves as rows, where each row consists of each model's column shape similarity score for each wave. This dataset is stored under the Evaluation results directory.
- A dataset named `density_trend.csv`, with models as the attributes, and waves as rows, where each row consists of each model's column pair trend score for each wave. This dataset is stored under the Evaluation results directory.
- A dataset named `density_overall.csv`, with models as the attributes, and waves as rows, where each row consists of each model's overall similarity score for each wave. This dataset is stored under the Evaluation results directory.
- A dataset named `c2st.csv` with models as the attributes, and waves as rows, where each row consists of each model's C2ST score for each wave. This dataset is stored under the Evaluation results directory.

The code can be found in `generate_evals.py`.
